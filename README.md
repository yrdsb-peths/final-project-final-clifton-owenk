<<Summary of the Project>>

Jet Survival

This is a Jet Survival game. The Jet automatically fires bullets to take down waves of colorful drone enemies and earn coins.

After 30 seconds, a powerful enemy enters the battle — the MiniBoss. It descends from the top and fires deadly missiles from both wings.

To win the battle, the Jet must:
-> Dodge missiles
-> Avoid crashing into the MiniBoss
-> Take down the MiniBoss, which is much more resistant to attacks than the drones

Only by defeating the MiniBoss before the Jet is destroyed can the player win the game.

<<For Teacher>>
- There is currently no cheat mode.

- To get to the end screen (Defeat):
  - Once the game starts,
  - Adjust the speed slider to speed up the game,
  - This will usually lead you to the Defeat screen.

- To reach the end screen with Victory:
  - Once the game starts,
  - Move the Jet to the far left or far right side of the screen to avoid collisions with enemies or missiles from the MiniBoss.
  - However, you will still need to dodge some enemies occasionally.
